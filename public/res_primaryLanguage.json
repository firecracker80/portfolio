      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yajahira Velazquez, you can call me Yari. I am an army veteran with a background in policing, transportation management, and medicine. Currently I own a web design company, Digital Transformation Consulting and Solutions, where I offer services from web design to digital marketing. I started my company for two reasons, one, I love working with computers. Computers have given me the opportunity to unlock my creative side and critical thinking. I have always been a problem solver, working in tech, is solving one problem after the next. This is an area where I excel. More importantly, feel that tech is the way of the future and I want to be part of that.  The second reason is because, tech allows the possibility of working remotely. After I finished my contract with the army, I went to medical school in Dominican Republic. Unfortunately, my circumstances changed and I was unable to continue, but I decided to stay living here. Working remotely will also give me more time with my kids. ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜Ž",
